## [Unreleased] - [Date]

### What's New
- **Delete Scrum functionality**: You can now delete scrums directly from the list in the `ScrumsView`. Simply swipe to delete an item.

### Changes
- Refactored `ScrumsView` to use `ForEach` for displaying scrums, improving the structure and control over list items.
- Adjusted row background color handling to work correctly with the new `ForEach` structure.
